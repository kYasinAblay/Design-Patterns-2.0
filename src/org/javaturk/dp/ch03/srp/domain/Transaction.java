/**
 * Any operation that changes the balance of the acount is a transaction. There are four
 * different types of transaction. They all inherit from this class and that's why Transaction class
 * is abstract. Subclasses are Deposit, Withdraw, Transafer, EFT and Payment.
 * 
 * Transaction class has two constructors. One is called when a new transaction is created. Its no 
 * is inserted by a trigger when the row is created in the database. But when the row is fetched
 * from the database and a corresponding object is created its fetched no is used in the second 
 * constructor.
